MOVIE ME

This is a project I did for a company test. I did it in a week aprox.
According to the requirements sended by this company, and considering the short time to make this app, 
I want to make some observations about this code:

2- I don't reach to finish the following things:
  1.1 - load next pages when you finish to slide the first page in the movie lists. I did the refresh page but not the load pages. You only will see one page.
  1.2 - I don't reach to finish sign up
  1.3 - styles are embebbed. I have no time to put them in Styles file, will do
  1.4 - I use an existence key
  1.5 - I create a user to make the login.
  1.6 - Some UI stuff such as Favorite Button (the services exists but dont reach to call it)
  
Things actually made:

1 - API consumed to login and authenticate
2 - API consumed to make querys for all movie lists and some others HTTP GETS
2 - Project structure
3 - Pull to refresh
4 - Dependency injection
